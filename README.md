# Economy_RIPGLA

This repository contains code and results files from Eunsun Jou's second MIT linguistics generals paper.
Specifically, it contains:

1. A python implementation of the RIP/GLA, available as the module gla.py
2. An economy-based amendment to the RIP/GLA, also available in the gla.py module
3. A set of 68 randomly sampled abstract metrical stress languages, available in /languages
4. Files resulting from learning trials using the RIP/GLA and its amended version, available in /results

gla.py is intended to be loaded as a module in a separate python script.
worbench.py is an example script that loads the module and actually does the learning.
