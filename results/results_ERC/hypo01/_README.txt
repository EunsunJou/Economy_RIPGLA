Lang 01 was originally labeled Lang 67, and Lang 02 was originally labeled Lang 68. Due to a procedural error, I excluded Lang 01 and Lang 02 after running the simulations. In reporting study results in the Proceedings of AMP 2022, I re-labeled the last two languages, lang 67 and Lang 68, to Lang 01 and Lang 02 respectively. This makes the last label of the list of languages "Lang 66", avoiding confusion about the number of languages. But the result files themselves still bear the label "hypo67" and "hypo68", since I figured it was best to not touch the result files themselves.
